Transfer Learning with Xception for TensorFlow-Flowers Classification

This project utilizes transfer learning to classify images of different flower species in the TensorFlow-Flowers dataset using a pre-trained Xception model. Xception is a convolutional neural network with 71 layers that has been trained on more than a million images from the ImageNet database, and can classify images into 1000 object categories.

To fine-tune the Xception model for the TensorFlow-Flowers dataset, the last few layers of the model are unfrozen, and a few additional layers are added on top of the model, including a Global Average Pooling layer and a Dense layer with softmax activation for classification. The model is then trained on the TensorFlow-Flowers dataset to adjust the pre-trained weights and learn to classify the new set of images.

It's important to preprocess the images in the TensorFlow-Flowers dataset in a similar way as the ImageNet images were preprocessed when the Xception model was trainedby resizing the images to 299-by-299.

The TensorFlow-Flowers dataset contains 3670 images of 5 different flower species: daisy, dandelion, rose, sunflower, and tulip. The trained model can classify new images of these flower species with high accuracy.
